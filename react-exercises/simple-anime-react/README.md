# Instructions

Create a simple animation library that have the following things. Expose the API as React Components.

- Bounce
- FadeIn and Out with easing effects
- Slide up to limit and come back to original location
- Pulse

You can make your own API names. You can use either CSS to animate, or JavaScript such as `requestAnimationFrame`. Either is fine.
